:::danger Take care
## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️
:::

- Devnet should not be used as a replacement for Alpha testnet. After testing on Devnet, be sure to test on testnet (alpha-goerli)!
- Specifying a block by its hash/number is not supported for contract calls. All interaction is done with the latest block.
- There is no pending block. A new block is generated with each transaction.
- Sending transactions with max_fee set to 0 is supported (not supported on alpha-mainnet or alpha-goerli).
- Devnet is currently being adapted to Starknet and Cairo v0.10.0, if you spot any issues, please [report them](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/issues/new/choose)
